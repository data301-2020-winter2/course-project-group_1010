Health care remains a very important issue in todays world where the majority of the costs are thrown on patients. In the United States, health insurance is major concern given that public health insurance is not an option. This leaves millions of individuals without any health insurance if they are not able to afford insurance provided by the private sector. Given the importance of this topic, we decided to analyze the data in this data set to find any correlations that may exist between certain demographics and medical expenses. Could it be possible that different medical expenses are incurred based on geographic location, sex or age? Could individuals with different demographics be incurring different costs? These are all questions worth investigating and what we hope to answer through our analysis! 

We think setting up a dashboard to visualize our findings will be a very engaging and fun way to educate our peers and other individuals about this topic to hopefully promote incite about such assumptions.

The dataset was provided by Kaggle in 2018 and originates from the book Machine Learning with R by Brett Lantz, an introductory book on machine learning. The data set is in the public domain, although it required editing to match the use from the book. This dataset was used to educate readers of the book and can be used for a variety of analyses. From this, it is used to advance public interest in machine learning and potentially medical costs in the US.   
    
The dataset is a small sample of USA medical insurance costs. The content includes, age and sex of the insurance beneficiery, whether the benificiery has children and how many, health indicators like bmi, if the beneficiery is a smoker, insurance charges and region of the USA they are located in.
